			<h2> Our history </h2>

			<p> This journey started as a response to a need. The need to be able to adopt the style you want, when you want and for as long as you want. It's about being proud of your appearance, your hairstyle and feeling confident. As a matter of fact, we are interested in creativity and the versatility power given by wigs. It is this confidence that insecure people call insolence. So yes, our hair flip is insolent, we are insolently confident, and we are insolently here for it. </p>
